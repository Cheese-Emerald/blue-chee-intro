                               WAIT WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY AGAIN........................
|SU|
OH, RIGHT!                         
|SD|
HELLO PEOPLE OF THE WORLD!    

WE...ER...I GUESS ME (REPELLANTMOLD) AND SOMEONE ELSE (HIP) ARE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING...           
CHEESE|SD| EMERALD DEMOSCENE GROUP!!!               
|SU|
I DONT KNOW HOW RUNNING A DEMOSCENE GROUP WILL GO, BUT I SUPPOSE THATS PART OF THE FUN! 

THIS ENTIRE INTRODUCTION WAS MADE IN A PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR MAKING INTROS FROM THE 90S CALLED THG FX INTRO MAKER 3.0...     
BUT WHO REALLY CARES, WE HAD FUN DOING STUFF FOR IT, THATS ALL I CARE ABOUT!           

THE MUSIC THATS PLAYING IS MADE BY REPELLANTMOLD, USING SCREAM TRACKER II..                             
|SU|
REPELLANTMOLD DIDNT REALLY FEEL LIKE FINDING A PROGRAM TO FIT THE BILL OF BEING ABLE TO PLAY A MODULE FILE IN THE BACKGROUND, 
IT WOULDVE BEEN A TOTAL HACKJOB SINCE SHE WOULDVE HAD TO USE A BATCH FILE, OR CONVERT THE BATCH FILE TO AN EXECUTABLE ALONGSIDE THIS, THE PLAYER AND THE MODULE TOO,
SO THIS IS BASICALLY ALL YOURE GETTING FROM HER, WITH PLAYBACK FROM THE SCREAM TRACKER MUSIC INTERFACE KIT VIA SOUND BLASTER PLAYBACK (ASSUMING ITS EVEN PLAYING CORRECTLY RIGHT NOW.)                  
|SD|          
ALRIGHT, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE....
NOPE, I THINK THATS ABOUT IT....
|SU|
ALRIGHT GOODBYE EVERYONE, AND I WISH EVERYONE VIEWING THIS A PRETTY FANTASTIC DAY!
